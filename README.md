#Prerequisites:
•	Install and set up AWS CLI on your local machine.
•	Install Docker Desktop.
•	Install SAM CLI (Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface).
•	Have Python and pip installed on your local machine.
•	Have PostgreSQL installed and configured locally or have access to a remote PostgreSQL database.


#Setting up the Environment:
•	Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal.


#Initialize a new SAM project:
•	Run the following command to create a new SAM project:
sam init 
•	Choose the "AWS Quick Start Templates" - option.
•	Select the "1 - Hello World Example" template (for simplicity in this example).


#Develop Lambda Function and Test Locally:
•	Navigate to the "hello_world" directory inside your project directory.
•	Modify the app.py file to write your Lambda function in Python.


#After modifying app.py - Build Sam:
•	After performing modification/Changes in app.py – make sure you saved (Ctrl + S)
•	Run following command to build sam file:
sam build


#Testing the Lambda Function Locally:
•	Run the following command to test the function locally:
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction –events/event.json 
•	Ensure your function works as expected.


#Configuring Docker for Local Testing:
•	SAM CLI can leverage Docker for a Lambda-like execution environment. This helps you simulate AWS Lambda locally.
•	Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your machine.


#Externalizing API Endpoints and Credentials:
•	Create a configuration file (e.g., config.json) to store all your API endpoints and credentials.
•	Load the configurations in your Python code using configparser or other appropriate libraries.
•	Never hard-code sensitive information in your code.


#Create AWS CloudFormation Scripts:
•	Create a CloudFormation template (template.yml) to define your serverless application's infrastructure.
•	Define AWS resources like Lambda function, API Gateway, IAM roles, etc., in the CloudFormation template.
•	Use the AWS::Serverless::Function resource type to define your Lambda function.
•	You can reference environment variables, API endpoints, and other configurations from the configuration file in your CloudFormation template.


#Deploy the Application:
•	Use the following command to deploy your SAM application to AWS:
sam deploy --guided 
•	The --guided flag will prompt you for configurations like stack name, AWS Region, etc.


#Testing the Deployed Application:
•	After successful deployment, test your Lambda function and the API endpoints using the AWS Management Console.
